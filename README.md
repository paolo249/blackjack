Demonstrates the game Black Jack
Black_Jack (21)
Student Objective: Demonstrates ability to create a web browser game
Game Objective: Player and computer must attempt to reach close to or exactly 21 in order to win the game! 
 If he/she goes over 21, he/she "busts" and the game is over.

//in the start of the program the player(user) will have the opportunity to choose two options: User can play
 the game or quit the program overall

// If player chooses to play the game he/she will be dealt two cards in the main screen. 
(Both of these cards will be random generated)


//At this point player is presented with two options he/she can choose from.  The first option is to "hit", 
which basically means that player is able to get another random card.  The second option is to "stay", in which
case the player decides to keep his/her cards.

// If the first option is considered his/her cards will be summed up and his/her total value of cards will be updated.
  Technically speaking the program will then check if the total value of cards are less than, equal to, or greater than 21. 

//Winning Conditions:
* 		If player’s total representative value is strictly equal to 21.  He/She wins the game!
* 		If player’s total representative value is closer to 21.  He/She wins the game!  
* 		Computer will also have the same winning conditions as player.
